# OPERATOR DESK — what the loop is waiting on YOU for

One row per pending human gate. The loop adds a row whenever it halts for the
operator; the operator answers by saying the exact word(s) in **Say**. Cleared
rows are removed (history lives in the loop state and git log). Empty table =
nothing is asked of you.

Rules for the loop:
- Every halt-for-the-operator MUST be a row here — never buried in prose or a PR
  comment. A gate that is not on the desk was not asked.
- Each row includes one short context paragraph directly below the table row it
  belongs to: what happened, the recommendation, and what stays blocked.
- Never edit or reinterpret an existing row's **Say** word; add a new row instead.

| ID | Say | Question | Recommendation | Since | Blocks |
|----|-----|----------|----------------|-------|--------|

_Empty — nothing is asked of the operator._

<!-- Resolved 2026-07-05 (operator ratified both at iteration-1 kickoff):
     D-002 `scope pushes` — DIRECTIVE item 2 push rule scoped to halt only on
       pushes to main outside the gated pr-manager merge pipeline, pushes to new
       remotes, force-pushes, and deploys; feature-branch pushes authorized.
       Direct state-sync pushes to main remain gated off (repo.allow_state_sync_push
       stays false — those are pushes to main outside the merge pipeline).
     D-003 `align seals` — DIRECTIVE sealed-gate list now names the pr-manager
       review stages (scripts/pr-manager/prompts/) and system-architecture.md,
       matching CLAUDE.md. -->
